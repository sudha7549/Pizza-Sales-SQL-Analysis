# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Analysis

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales SQL Analysis** project! This repository presents a data analysis case study using SQL to extract meaningful insights from a fictional pizza restaurant's sales data.

## üìä Project Overview

This project dives deep into pizza sales data to address key business questions and uncover valuable insights. Through the power of SQL queries, we explore performance metrics, customer behavior, and revenue trends.

The analysis helps in answering real-world questions like:

- Which pizza type brings the most revenue?
- What time of day has the highest number of orders?
- What are the top-selling pizzas and sizes?
- How do sales trends evolve over time?
