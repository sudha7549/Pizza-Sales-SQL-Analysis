        JOIN
    order_details ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.category
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

-- 2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.alter

sum(revenue) over (order by order_date) as cum_revenue
from
(select orders.order_date,
sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue
from order_details join pizzas
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
join orders 
on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id
group by orders.order_date) as sales;

rank() over (partition by category order by revenue desc) as rn
from 
(select pizza_types.category, pizza_types.name,
sum((order_details.quantity) * pizzas.price) as revenue
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
group by pizza_types.category, pizza_types.name) as a) as b
